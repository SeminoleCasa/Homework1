There is little advice that can be given to Citadel, who is already engaged in the use of cutting-edge fintech products, including high-speed trading, market making, and asset management, all using proprietary algorithms. I think their business model is excellent, particularly the fact that they are not a publicly traded company. This allows them to avoid significant expenses related to compliance as well as prevents their proprietary business information from being accessible by the public, which includes their competitors.

Using the information that is available from internally available sources (various companies/connections? / business intelligence), they could expand into a more diverse field outside the traditional markets, such as commercial real estate development, providing analytics support, support for hospitals and other healthcare facilities, and large scale consulting work.
