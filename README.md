There is little advice that can be given to Citadel, who is already engaged in the use of cutting-edge fintech products, including high-speed trading, market making, and asset management, all using proprietary algorithms. I think their business model is excellent, particularly the fact that they are not a publicly traded company. This allows them to avoid significant expenses related to compliance as well as prevents their proprietary business information from being accessible by the public, which includes their competitors.

Using the information that is available from internally available sources (various companies/connections? / business intelligence), they could expand into a more diverse field outside the traditional markets, such as commercial real estate development, providing analytics support, support for hospitals and other healthcare facilities, and large scale consulting work.

Sell market and business information to the government for analysis purposes.

They could stand up a distributed ledger and provide transaction tracking services for a variety of industries. The distributed ledger mechanism provides a robust mechanism for tracking transactions and is nearly impossible to hack.

They could trade cryptocurrency using knowledge gained from years of high-frequency trading algorithms.
